# Py-DNS-over-HTTPS-Proxy
Provides a simple Python based proxy for running DNS over HTTPS to Google's DNS over HTTPS service.

Recently I wrote a blog post which probably gives you just enough information to get this up and running on a Mac / Linux box... https://www.robertputt.co.uk/2017/01/06/securing-dns-traffic-with-dns-over-https/, please note this script only seems to play nice with Python2.7 not Python 3.x
